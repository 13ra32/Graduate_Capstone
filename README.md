# Autonomous Drone Racing with Camera Based State Estimation

In collaboration with the Hybrid Robotics Laboratory at UC Berkeley, we developed autonomous flight technology in the form of state estimation and path planning software for an autonomous racing quadcopter. The result was a software pipeline that creates a point cloud map of an indoor or outdoor racetrack using an Intel D435i depth camera and identifies the optimum global trajectory though the racetrack.
 

## Description
This repository contains the ROS code for running the mapping â€“ planning software framework for the Autonomous Drone Racing Using Camera Based State Estimation capstone project. The code is presented in three separate catkin workspaces. 
Catkin_ws_a and Catkin_ws_trr are fully assembled.
Catkin_ws_r will require the user to use the catkin_make command to build it. 
Here is the compressed fully built Catkin_ws_r file https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R-WwLrWupxcx-CK5uR445IeeCpPop_wc

TRR_With_Custom_Map.sh includes all terminal commands to run the program. 

Simulation Instruction Document contains on overview of how to operate the code, installation dependencies, and description of how to modify the output

Once the code is installed, use the videos below to run the program.
